# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Exploring relationships between testing rates, deaths, and population metrics across countries using SQL (PostgreSQL + DBeaver).

## Dataset
- Our World in Data (OWID): cases per million, deaths per million, doses per million, population, estimates cumulative excess mortality per 100000.

## Questions
- Which countries show the largest gap between reported deaths and excess-mortality estimates?
- Is there a correlation between testing rates and death rates?
- Does correlation change when shifting deaths by 21 days?
- what is the mortality rate in each country?

## Methods
- building a personal server.
- building personal DB- Schema, Tables, data.
- SQL queries.
- Cleaning and normalization per country & date
- Correlation calculations and comparisons

## Tools
PostgreSQL · DBeaver · GitHub
