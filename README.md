# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Exploring relationships between testing rates, deaths, and population metrics across countries using SQL (PostgreSQL + DBeaver).

## Dataset
- Our World in Data (OWID): cases per million, deaths per million, doses per million, population, estimates cumulative excess mortality per 100000.

## Questions
- Is there a correlation between testing rates and death rates?
- Do correlations change when shifting deaths by 14–21 days?
- Which countries show the largest gap between reported deaths and excess-mortality estimates?

## Methods
- SQL queries (window functions, aggregations, joins)
- Cleaning and normalization per country & date
- Correlation calculations and comparisons

## Tools
PostgreSQL · DBeaver · GitHub

## Results (high level)
- Add 2–3 bullet points once you finalize findings.
