The chart shows that countries on the left had underestimated mortality mortality- actual deaths were higher than predicted.
In contast, countries on the right had overestimated mortality- actual death lower than expected.
  
question 2- 
In most countries, no direct correlation was found between the number of tests and the mortality rate- an increase in testing did not necessarily lead to a decrease in deaths, and vice versa.
It is importent to note that the correlation is based on data that differs across countries- in terms of data quality, reporting scope, and timing- which may influence the observed results.

question 3-
In most countries, no direct correlation was found between the number of tests and the mortality after 21 days rate- an increase in testing did not necessarily lead to a decrease in deaths, and vice versa.
It is importent to note that the correlation is based on data that differs across countries- in terms of data quality, reporting scope, and timing- which may influence the observed results.
